The case for the healthcare industry has been no different. In recent years, hospitals have adopted new and improved digital health record systems, which has led to a rapid increase in available healthcare data. Such data includes various kinds of information that can span from patient background and demographics to laboratory test results, prescribed medications, and treatment outcomes. It is not difficult to see that, when combined with the tools of data analytics, this kind of data holds immense potential in not only improving patient care and outcomes, but also in streamlining large-scale healthcare operations. Some such real-world applications of healthcare data include predictive analytics, in which insights into patient care and potential treatments can be extracted from large amounts of data in order to guide real-world doctors in making the correct decisions for their patients. This has been seen to be extremely useful in the case of patients with complicated medical histories, for whom big data can provide possibly important predictions. Another example is hospital staffing, for which data on hospital traffic can produce efficient schedules for. Acknowledging the significance of healthcare data in the field of data analytics, we have chosen to study a healthcare-related dataset for this final project. In particular, the dataset we hhave chosen to study comprises clinical data collected on hundreds of thousands patient stays in a hospital. The data is composed on information regarding patients’ medical histories, physiological lab results, as well as the lengths of each individual patients’ stay in the hospital. The main question we aim to answer at the end of this project is: How is the length of a patient’s stay in the hospital related to their medical history and physiological state? We hope that the findings of this project will be able to guide hospital managements in correctly anticipating staffing needs and resource allocations according to a patient’s medical history and physiological data upon their admission. If this is successful, this will contribute towards bettering hospitals’ large-scale operations. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The dataset we are exploring comes from a database called MIMIC-III. MIMIC-III is a freely available database which contains the data of tens of thousands of patients admitted to the critical care unit of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachussetts, between the years 2001 and 2012. The MIMIC-III database is a very popular data source for researchers interested in healthcare data, since all of its data is freely available, the data is collected from a wide range of patients from largely differing demographics, and also includes very detailed data on patient care and results. The data in this database is collected by healthcare workers of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center during their routine work, through two different critical care information systems. One such critical care system is the Philips CareVue Clinical Information System, and the other such critical care system is the iMDsoft MetaVision ICU. These critical care information systems record clinical data such as physiological data (i.e. heart rate, blood pressure, etc.), as well as documented progress notes throughout patient care provided by hospital caregivers. However, the database also contains records that are not exclusively collected by these information systems. Additional information is also included, such as patient demographics, laboratory test results, and admission and discharge summaries. As mentioned previously, the particular dataset from the MIMIC-III database that we are studying regards the hospital stays of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center patients. In total, there are 100,000 patient stays recorded in this dataset. As expected, the data contains a combination of both categorical and numerical data. The categorical data comprises some basic information about the patient admitted, including their gender (gender), the number of readmissions in the last 180 days (rcount), and the ID of the facility into which they were admitted (facid). The other categorical data in this dataset pertains to the medical histories of these patients – whether they have certain medical issues such as: renal disease, asthma, iron deficiency, pneumonia, substance dependence, depression, psychological disorder, fibrosis, malnutrition, and blood disorder. The data also contains numerical data, which are the results of laboratory tests or basic physiological measurements. Laboratory test results in this dataset include hematocrit levels, neutrophil levels, sodium levels, glucose levels, blood urea nitrogen levels, and creatinine levels. Physiological measurements in this dataset include BMI, average pulse, and average respiration. Of course, for each patient stay, the length of the stay has also been recorded. Data on the dates of admissions and dates of discharges were also included, but this was not useful to us, since in the de-identification process required of the MIMIC-III database by the Health Insurance Portability Act (HIPAA), the dates were randomized or transformed to further into the future in order to protect the anonymity of the patients. This prevented us from exploring how different months or seasons affected patient stays. However, the lengths of the patients’ stays were preserved, and this is the variable that we were able to focus on.

We notice a connection between the Length of Stay and: - the average hematocrit value during encounter - the average blood urea nitrogen value during encounter - the average respiration during encounter These observations are confirmed by the correlation matrix below: Moreover this correlation matrix shows us connections among the physiological data: indeed, there is a clear correlation between the average blood urea nitrogen value and the the average respiration, and also between the average blood urea nitrogen value and the average hematocrit value. This latter correlation motivates us to deepen our analysis and we will try to detect more patterns between the blood urea nitrogen value, average hematocrit value and the Length of Stay of a patient in this hospital. Although it seems scriptsly unclear, this scatterplot shows interesting patterns. We can deduce two things: - The localisation of the points shows that the high values of blood urea nitrogen are associated to low values of hematocrit (it is almost impossible to have high values for both) - The intensity of the purple increases from the top left to the bottom right of the graph (an intense shade of purple means a high value for Length of Stay): it means that the length of stay increases with high blood urea nitrogen values and low hematocrit values. Finally these heatmaps confirms our previous analysis: when the Length of Stay increases, the bins of the heatmaps spread toward the bottom right of the graphs which means that patients with low hematocrit values and high blood urea nitrogen values have a much more higher probability to stay a long time in the hospital than other patients. 5.3 Analysis of Categorical Data: Pre-Existing Conditions &amp; Number of Previous Admissions The boxplot in plot A clearly shows that the length of stay for a patient is generally higher if the patient has some pre-existing conditions in comparison to if they do not have any. In fact, the median stay length for patients without any conditions (2 days) is much shorter than the the median stay length for patients with conditions (5 days). Notably, as seen in the bar chart of plot B, there are no patients who had pre-existing conditions that also stayed at the hospital for less than 3 days. The distributions of hospital stay lengths for patients both without and with pre-existing conditions are uni-modal and right-skewed; they both peak at the shortest length of stay. However, the interquartile range for patients without conditions is much larger (about twice the size) than that for patients with conditions, indicating that although most patients without conditions had a short hospital stay, there also were a noteworthy number of these patients who had longer stays than their condition history would suggest. However, of patients who had the longest hospital stays (8, 9+ days), more had pre-existing conditions, as seen in plot B. As seen in the bar graph of plot A, most of the patients admitted did not have any pre-existing medical conditions. A substantial amount of admitted patients had 1 or 2 conditions, but few had more than 3. The cleveland dot plot in plot B shows that, as the length of stay in hospital increases, the number of conditions that the patient has generally increases. Patients who stayed only 1-2 days in the hospital all have 0 conditions. However, as the length of stay increases, it is clear to see that the number of patients who have no conditions decreases. This is also the case for patients who have 1 or 2 conditions, and for patients who have 3 conditions - though to a lesser extent. However, patients with no/few conditions are the most abundant, and even as the length of stay increases, there are more patients with few conditions than many. Patients who have 4 or more conditions stayed for a minimum of 4 days, though there are very few of them and the number of such patients for each length of stay is generally constant. Overall, this shows that the more pre-existing conditions a patient has, the more likely it is for them to stay longer in the hospital. The bar graph in plot A shows that the majority of admitted patients had not been previously admitted to the hospital. The rest of the patients had previously been admitted to the hospital 1, 2, 3, 4 times at similar frequencies. The cleveland dot plot in plot B shows that, as the number of previous admissions increases, the length of stay in the hospital also generally increases. The number of patients who either had 0 or 1 previous admissions to the hospital generally decreases as the length of stay increases. In fact the patients who had the shortest stays (1-3 days) had at most only 1 previous admission. Up until stays of 4 days, it can be seen that patients who had the fewest (i.e. 0) previous admissions were generally the most abundant. However, interestingly, this trend reverses for stays of 6 days or longer. For stays of 6 ore more days, it seems that patients who have a high number of previous admissions are the more abundant, whereas patients with few previous admissions are rarer. In fact, of the patients that had the longest stays (9+ days), all had been admitted to the hospital at least twice, with patients who had 5 or more previous admissions being the most common. The above mosaic plot shows that there is a positive relationship between the number of conditions, the number of previous admissions, and the length of stay. (Note: For clarity in the mosaic plot, the number of categories for each variable has been decreased. “Short” stays in the hospital refer to those that are 4 days (the median length of stay) or less, and “long” stays in the hospital refer to those that are 5 days or more.) For patients who had 0 previous admissions, the proportion of patients who had “long” stays increased as the number of conditions increased. This trend is also seen for patients with 1 or 2 previous admissions to the hospital. Patients who had 3 or more previous admissions, however, all had “long” hospital stays regardless of the number of conditions, suggesting that for these patients, the number of conditions is irrelevant or at least not as important. The above plot is a plot visualizing the top 8 most common patterns of conditions admitted patients have. In the top-most tile plot, each column represents a pattern of condition that a certain number of admitted patients presented, and each row represents a single medical condition. A grey tile means that this pattern does not include this condition, whereas a pink tile means that the pattern does. For example, pattern 1 (column 1) is the pattern where the patient did not have any of the conditions. Pattern 2 (column 2) is the pattern where the patient only had psychological disorder major, but not any of the other conditions. The columns are ordered from 1 to 8 by frequency in the data set, which can be seen in the bar graph below, showing the percentage frequency of each pattern. The majority of admitted patients did not have any of the conditions (pattern 1), and the next seven most common patterns were comparatively much rarer. Most of the top patterns had only one of the given conditions, although patterns 4 and 8 had two conditions each. In these patterns, the most common condition was psychological disorder major (seen in 3 patterns) and iron deficiency (seen in 2 patterns). Some conditions were not seen at all in the top patterns, such as pneumonia or malnutrition. The above boxplot shows that the patients who exhibited the most common pattern (no conditions) generally had a shorter stay in the hospital than patients exhibiting any other pattern. In fact, the median length of stay for patients with condition pattern 1 (2 days) was shorter than the minimum length of stay for patients of any other condition pattern. Interestingly, the 5 of the next 7 most common condition patterns had the same median length of stay (5 days), while the other 2 patterns also had the same median length (4 days). The minimums and 75th quartiles of all the next top 7 patterns were also all the same.
